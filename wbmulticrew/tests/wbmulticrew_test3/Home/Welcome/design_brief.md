**Welcome Section Design Brief**

**Section Overview:**
The Welcome section is the first impression of the website, setting the tone for the rest of the user experience. It should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provide a clear understanding of the coffee house's offerings.

**Section Layout:**
The Welcome section will consist of a hero section, a brief introduction to the coffee house, and a call-to-action (CTA) to encourage visitors to explore the website further.

**Hero Section:**
The hero section will feature a high-quality image of the coffee house's interior or a specialty coffee blend. The image will be accompanied by a brief introduction to the coffee house, highlighting its unique offerings and atmosphere.

**Introduction:**
The introduction will be a brief paragraph (approx. 100-150 words) that provides an overview of the coffee house, its mission, and its commitment to quality and sustainability.
