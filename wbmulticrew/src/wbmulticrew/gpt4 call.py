also, is there a way to have a trial period of something like that maybe for a week or 2 to see the effectiveness and conversion rates and revenues to be expected?
Alternative Partnership Structures:

Yes, there are alternative partnership structures that can allow Christophe to take advantage of your user base without fully selling your startup. Here are a few possibilities:

Revenue-sharing agreement: You can negotiate a revenue-sharing agreement where Christophe's company pays you a percentage of the revenue generated from your user base. This way, you can still benefit from the partnership without giving up ownership of your startup.
Joint venture: You can form a joint venture with Christophe's company, where you both contribute resources and expertise to create a new product or service that leverages your user base. This way, you can share the risks and rewards of the partnership.
Licensing agreement: You can license your user base to Christophe's company for a specific period, allowing them to use your user base for their marketing efforts. In return, you can negotiate a fee or revenue-sharing agreement.
Trial Period or Pilot Project:

Yes, it's a great idea to propose a trial period or pilot project to test the effectiveness of the partnership. This can help you both gauge the conversion rates, revenue potential, and overall feasibility of the partnership.

Here's an example of how you could structure a trial period:

Pilot project: Propose a 2-4 week pilot project where Christophe's company can access a limited portion of your user base (e.g., 10% of your users). This will allow you to test the conversion rates, revenue potential, and overall effectiveness of the partnership.
Trial period metrics: Establish clear metrics to measure the success of the pilot project, such as conversion rates, revenue generated, and user engagement. This will help you both evaluate the effectiveness of the partnership and make adjustments as needed.
Revenue-sharing during the trial: Negotiate a revenue-sharing agreement for the trial period, where Christophe's company pays you a percentage of the revenue generated during the trial.
Example proposal:

"Let's propose a 4-week pilot project where Christophe's company can access 10% of my user base. We can establish clear metrics to measure the success of the pilot, including conversion rates, revenue generated, and user engagement. During the trial period, we can negotiate a revenue-sharing agreement where Christophe's company pays me 20% of the revenue generated. If the pilot is successful, we can discuss a longer-term partnership or revenue-sharing agreement."

By proposing a trial period or pilot project, you can mitigate the risks associated with the partnership and ensure that both parties are aligned on the goals and expectations of the collaboration.


are there any things that I should ask for right now?
like how do I know how is website converts right now? as the success of deal depends on his website, more than mine.

also, is there a possibility to have the offer such that if the targets aren't met, I dont have to sell my startup?
Requesting Information on Christophe's Website:

Yes, it's essential to understand the conversion rates and performance of Christophe's website, as it will directly impact the success of the deal. You should ask Christophe to provide you with the following information:

Current conversion rates: Ask for the average conversion rate of his website, including the number of visitors, leads, and paying customers.
User engagement metrics: Request data on user engagement, such as time on site, bounce rate, and pages per session.
Revenue and profit margins: Ask for information on the average revenue per user (ARPU), customer lifetime value (CLV), and profit margins.
Marketing and sales strategies: Understand how Christophe currently acquires customers, including his marketing channels, sales funnels, and customer acquisition costs.
Contingency Clauses:

Yes, you can negotiate contingency clauses that protect your interests in case the targets aren't met. Here are some possibilities:

Performance-based milestones: Tie the payment structure to specific performance milestones, such as revenue targets or user engagement metrics. If these targets aren't met, the payment structure can be adjusted or the deal can be terminated.
Earn-out structure: Implement an earn-out structure where Christophe's company pays you a percentage of the revenue generated from your user base over a certain period. If the revenue targets aren't met, the earn-out payments can be reduced or terminated.
Option to terminate: Negotiate a clause that allows you to terminate the agreement if the targets aren't met within a certain timeframe. This would give you the option to walk away from the deal if Christophe's company fails to deliver on their promises.
Right of first refusal: Consider asking for a right of first refusal, which would allow you to buy back your startup if Christophe's company fails to meet the targets.
Example Contingency Clause:

"Upon failure to meet the revenue target of $15,000 within 6 months of the closing date, the Seller shall have the option to terminate this Agreement and regain ownership of the Assets. In such event, the Buyer shall return the Assets to the Seller, and the Seller shall refund any payments made by the Buyer under this Agreement."

Remember to carefully negotiate and draft these contingency clauses to ensure they align with your goals and protect your interests.

Here is the rest of the example LOI:

The purchase price for the Assets shall be $10,000, payable as follows:

$3,000 upon execution of this Letter of Intent
$3,000 upon completion of the due diligence process
4,000 upon reaching a revenue target of 15,000 in subscription revenue within 6 months of the closing date
The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith and execute a Definitive Agreement within 30 days of the execution of this Letter of Intent.

The Definitive Agreement shall include, among other things, warranties, representations, and covenants customary for transactions of this kind.

The Parties agree to work together in good faith to ensure a smooth transition of the Assets and to maximize the value of the Assets.

Please note that this is just an example, and you should adjust the terms and conditions to fit your specific needs and circumstances.

Additional Demands:

Consider asking for a guarantee or warranty from Christophe's company that they will not compete with Answer AI for a certain period, such as 12 to 24 months.
Request that Christophe's company provides you with regular updates on the performance of the Assets, including financial reports and user engagement metrics.
Ask for a provision that allows you to terminate the agreement if Christophe's company fails to meet certain performance targets or milestones.
Remember to carefully review and negotiate the terms of the LOI and Definitive Agreement to ensure that they align with your goals and protect your interests. It's also a good idea to consult with a lawyer or financial advisor to ensure that you're getting a fair deal.


for the financial part of this LOI, can you suggest an LOI that I can send to Christophe, or maybe a series of suggestions or demands, that I should ask for?
Based on the LOI provided, here are some suggestions or demands you could consider making to Christophe regarding the financial aspects of the acquisition:

Alternative Payment Structure:

Instead of the proposed 8,000 payment structure, consider asking for a higher upfront payment, such as 2,000 to $3,000, with the remaining amount tied to performance targets.
Alternatively, you could propose a revenue-sharing model, where Christophe's company pays you a percentage of the revenue generated from your user base over a certain period.
Escrow Agent and Performance Targets:

Request that the escrow agent holds a larger percentage of the payment, such as 50% or 60%, to ensure that Christophe's company is committed to meeting the performance targets.
Clarify the specific metrics and KPIs that will be used to measure the success of the acquisition, and ensure that they are realistic and achievable.
Milestone Payments:

Instead of the proposed payment structure, consider asking for milestone payments tied to specific achievements, such as:
$2,000 upon completion of the due diligence process
$2,000 upon execution of the Definitive Agreement
2,000 upon reaching a certain revenue target (e.g., 10,000 in subscription revenue)
$2,000 upon reaching a certain user engagement target (e.g., 10,000 active users)
Earn-out Structure:

Consider proposing an earn-out structure, where Christophe's company pays you a percentage of the revenue generated from your user base over a certain period, such as 12 to 24 months.
This could be tied to specific performance targets, such as revenue growth or user engagement metrics.
Example LOI:

Here's an example of an LOI that incorporates some of these suggestions:

"Dear Christophe,

I am pleased to accept your proposal to acquire Answer AI, subject to the following terms and conditions:

The purchase price for the Assets shall be $10,000, payable as follows:
$3,000

Here's a rewritten message taking into account the full LOI:

Subject: Re: Letter of Intent for Acquisition of Answer AI

Dear Christophe,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our discussion yesterday regarding the acquisition of Answer AI. I appreciate your interest in my platform and the potential opportunities we discussed.

After reviewing the Letter of Intent (LOI) you provided, I have some concerns and questions that I'd like to address. While I understand the general terms outlined in the LOI, I believe it's essential to clarify and refine certain aspects of the agreement to ensure a mutually beneficial deal.

Specifically, I'd like to request the following:

More detailed performance targets: Could you provide more specific metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure the success of the acquisition? I'd like to understand how the revenue generated from my user base will be tracked, verified, and shared.
Higher initial payment: Considering the potential value of my user base, I believe the initial payment of $800 is relatively low. Would you be open to negotiating a higher upfront payment?
Warranties and indemnities: To protect both parties' interests, I think it's essential to include warranties and indemnities in the Definitive Agreement. This would provide a clear understanding of our respective responsibilities and liabilities.
Dispute resolution mechanism: In the event of a dispute, I'd like to establish a clear process for resolving any issues that may arise. This could include arbitration or mediation, for example.
Regarding the LOI, I'd like to discuss the following points:

Section 2: Could you provide more details on how the escrow agent will hold the funds and how the performance targets will be measured and verified?
Section 3: I'd like to understand the scope of the Definitive Agreement and the ancillary agreements. Could you provide more information on what these agreements will entail?
Section 7: I'd like to clarify the exclusivity period and the terms of the non-solicitation agreement.
To move forward, I'd appreciate it if you could provide a revised LOI that addresses these concerns. I'm open to negotiating the terms and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

Please let me know your thoughts on these points, and I look forward to discussing them further.

Best regards,

Bilal

Meeting Transcript:

 00:00:04.280 --> 00:01:18.954
<v Speaker A>okay, so we are going to put some marketing message in your applications on the website saying that when people log that, i don't know exactly how we are going to phrase it, but basically on cell ai is closing on, you have some opportunity to open an account on the document ai, which is great on all these link that go to the website will have a special tracker. so when they come to document we know that they come from you. and we just count the revenue that generated by people coming from these 90,000 people that you have in the list. we can also do some mailing a bit later. we can do several steps. even with a very low question rate. you are going to have people who buy subscriptions on dokenizer ai. and as soon as the target we put in the letter of intent are rich, then i will do the payment on your site. that's very pretty simple.</v>

00:01:22.194 --> 00:02:00.114
<v Speaker B>so first i was a little confused about one thing that like since i didn't have much experience with these like acquisition office etc. so i spent a lot of time yesterday like learning about like the different deal structures etc. so the way that the deals is currently structured is 10% of the actual asking price is enter in the closing fee. and the rest 90% is like in the in out phase, right?</v>

00:02:01.254 --> 00:03:17.564
<v Speaker A>yeah it's, it's the 90% is a subject to condition that we meet on conversion. because obviously my interest here, you can understand that if you put you in my shoes. my interest is that i have some new subscriber on tokenizer. otherwise i mean what you did is great, but i don't have any ambitions to maintain a pilot project for mine. so you can help me. i mean you can help me to phrase things well. so we got great conversion rate, but even, you know, even 90,000 if you got even supersonic conversion rate, that's 18,000 people convert on with the average subscriber purchase per month is $7 on my website. so you calculate 18,000 multiplied by $7. that's you, you are going to reach the target very fast. if we do absorb properly. the only way that we don't reach the target is that because actually there is uh, this email. are not uh, people are interested in ai. i don't know, but i, i think it's very, very uh, not very probable that we don't reach the target. right.</v>

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:51.864
<v Speaker B>to some extent i don't understand your point. and i do understand like your plan on like your reasoning behind the acquisition. but from my point of view it little subjective i would say. so basically i actually had an email chat with the people@acquire.com as well. so my reservation i would say is that.</v>

00:03:53.844 --> 00:04:06.014
<v Speaker A>why do you think, why do you think we won't be able to reach the target? why do you think we won't even reach 2% profession, right. that's the, you are not trust, you don't think that your email is not good enough.</v>

00:04:06.094 --> 00:04:38.034
<v Speaker B>so, so let me tell you. so as you know i have these like 90, 91,000 users sign signed up users at this point. but my own website has like different paid plans. right. so the number of actual paying users on the website is very very less. right. if i had, if i had a two or 3% conversion rate on my own website and maybe it's about for 90,000 users, 2% would be.</v>

00:04:39.934 --> 00:05:09.734
<v Speaker A>yeah, well i think about 80 the number of a low because don't maybe wrong. i mean you did a good job as a developer but your website is not on a marketing level or there is not so much added value compared to openai chat, gpt free or any of this is why people don't convert, you know?</v>

00:05:10.114 --> 00:05:10.610
<v Speaker B>yeah.</v>

00:05:10.682 --> 00:06:35.344
<v Speaker A>so you won't be able to, i mean with you need such effort to, to reach the kind of marketing and the kind of persuasions to convert your user base alone, you probably won't be able to do that. we are here to help you on that. so we have a tracking record. i have about our conversion rate from free to paid on our website is 5%. so just given, just give you an idea how we able to convert 90,000 people. if these people are interested in ai, they are going to convert probably the same rate as we have. of course many people won't convert. i know that, that's evident. it's not. we are going to convert 90% people. that would be great but i don't think it's realistic. but, but then this is your way to monetize your user base that you attract after if there are fake email and this is not people interested. that's true. but i need to be sure that we able to compare something. i cannot pay a database of 90,000 email if i don't have some idea that we have some guarantee that we have some results. do you understand that?</v>

00:06:37.784 --> 00:06:45.032
<v Speaker B>right. so i can assure you they're not like fake users or anything like that.</v>

00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:58.284
<v Speaker A>yeah, i know. i'm happy to trust you. i'm happy to trust you but you know, you know the, you know how, you know how business work, i mean, yeah, trust everyone but verify.</v>

00:06:58.824 --> 00:08:00.464
<v Speaker B>yeah, no, i actually understand, like, the point of view that you're coming from. but from my point of view, it's something like the conversion rate or how well the users convert on your website or how does a transition go from my website routing towards yours? so that do the thing, no problem. not be a lot of in my control. and my issue, like the thing that i was very, i would say i have the most reservation with is that the initial amount is $800. right. and if there's any reason, by any reason, if the target is not met, the acquisition will go forward with just dollar 800. so i confirm this with the acquisition team as well. i require, and i wanted to confirm this with you as well.</v>

00:08:00.764 --> 00:08:48.244
<v Speaker A>so the only, the only reason, the only reason, the only reason why the you, you get the final price of eight on dollar, the only reason that can exist is because the email database does. it's not what it is. so if it's that it doesn't even worth $800, i'm spending. so in my point of view, that's the only reason where i'm making a risk. because if i'm buying not a wealthy database of email, even $800 is too much. i mean, i want it to be zero for that. of course. otherwise, if we have quality email and people who are interested in ai, i'm very confident that we get a successful deal at the end.</v>

00:08:52.204 --> 00:08:53.064
<v Speaker B>all right.</v>

00:08:55.004 --> 00:09:23.684
<v Speaker A>okay. anyway, mohammed, i let you think over that letter of intent. you're not forced to sell, of course. this is your choice. this is your project. you do whatever you want. i think my proposition is fair. so i'm here to listen to your comment on other questions. if you want, take a few hours, a few days to think about that and we can speak again. no problem.</v>

00:09:23.984 --> 00:09:25.804
<v Speaker B>for sure. i will.</v>

00:09:31.384 --> 00:09:43.172
<v Speaker A>okay. okay. mohammad, thank you for your call on. happy to talk to you. always on the. just chat with me if you need. okay. have a great day.</v>

00:09:43.268 --> 00:09:43.916
<v Speaker B>thank you so much.</v>

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.052
<v Speaker A>bye.</v
Bilal, thank you for sharing the LOI and the meeting transcript. As your M&A lawyer, I'll provide you with my analysis and advice on how to navigate this deal.

Initial Observations:

The LOI is quite brief and lacks specific details on the transaction structure, warranties, and indemnities.
The purchase price is 8,000, with only 800 payable at closing, and the remaining $7,200 contingent on meeting specific performance targets.
The buyer, Christophe, is focused on leveraging your user base to drive subscriptions to his website, DocAnalyser.ai.
Concerns and Questions:

The LOI is heavily weighted in favor of the buyer, with most of the payment contingent on performance targets that may be difficult to achieve.
The initial payment of $800 is relatively low, considering the potential value of your user base.
There is no clear definition of what constitutes a "successful conversion" or how the revenue generated from your user base will be tracked and verified.
The LOI does not provide sufficient protection for you as the seller, particularly with regards to warranties, indemnities, and potential disputes.
Negotiation Strategy:

Request a more detailed and comprehensive LOI that addresses the concerns mentioned above.
Consider negotiating a higher initial payment, given the potential value of your user base.
Clarify the performance targets and the metrics used to measure success, ensuring that they are realistic and achievable.
Push for more specific language on how the revenue generated from your user base will be tracked, verified, and shared.
Insist on including warranties, indemnities, and dispute resolution mechanisms to protect your interests as the seller.
Next Steps:

Respond to Christophe, acknowledging receipt of the LOI and expressing your concerns and questions.
Request a revised LOI that addresses the issues mentioned above.
Consider seeking additional advice from a financial advisor or industry expert to help you navigate the deal.
Remember, Bilal, as the seller, you have the right to negotiate and advocate for a better deal. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance or support.""",
