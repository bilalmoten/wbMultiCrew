You will be writing the HTML code for a section of a website. I will provide you with instructions on the desired design, layout and functionality of the section, as well as the content to include, or an image to use as the guide.

Here are the instructions for the section:
<section_instructions>
{{SECTION_INSTRUCTIONS}}
</section_instructions>

And here is the content to include in the section:
<section_content>
{{SECTION_CONTENT}}
</section_content>

First, carefully review the provided section instructions and content. In the <scratchpad> below, write out your initial thoughts on how you will structure the HTML to meet the requirements. Consider what HTML elements and attributes you will need to use.

Now, write the HTML code for the website section below. Make sure to:

- Follow the design and layout instructions closely
- Include all the specified content
- Use semantic HTML elements where appropriate
- Do not add any content, functionality or design aspects that weren't requested in the instructions

Write your final HTML inside <html> tags.

Remember, your goal is to produce clean, valid HTML code that implements the website section exactly as described in the instructions, without any extraneous features or content.
